## Project Overview

This project is a client-side quiz platform for soccer (football) knowledge, designed to run entirely on GitHub Pages. It supports multiple quizzes, custom graphics, badges, and persistent user progress using browser localStorage. The platform is highly modular and easy to extend.

## Project Structure

```
soccer-quizzes/
  index.html                 # Landing page (lists quizzes, badges, user progress)
  /quizzes/
    quiz.html                # Generic quiz template (loads quiz data dynamically)
    defense.json             # Quiz data: Defense
    attack.json              # Quiz data: Attack
    ...                      # More quizzes
    manifest.json            # List of all available quizzes (metadata)
  /assets/
    /graphics/
      defense.svg            # (Placeholder: ‚öΩÔ∏è)
      attack.svg             # (Placeholder: ü•Ö)
      ...                    # More graphics (use emojis for now)
    /badges/
      defense-badge.svg      # (Placeholder: üèÖ)
      attack-badge.svg       # (Placeholder: ü•á)
      ...                    # More badges (emojis)
  /js/
    quiz.js                  # Quiz logic (for quiz.html)
    landing.js               # Landing page logic
    user.js                  # User memory, badges, progress logic
  style.css                  # Common styles
  README.md                  # Project documentation
```

## How to Add a New Quiz

1. **Create Quiz Data:**
   - Add a new JSON file in `/quizzes/` (e.g., `midfield.json`).
   - Use the structure below:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "midfield",
       "title": "Midfield Mastery Quiz",
       "description": "Test your midfield soccer knowledge!",
       "graphic": "üß†",
       "badge": "üéñÔ∏è",
       "themeColor": "#2563eb",
       "questions": [
         { "question": "Sample?", "options": ["A", "B"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Sample." }
       ]
     }
     ```
2. **Update Manifest:**
   - Add an entry for the new quiz in `/quizzes/manifest.json`.
3. **Add Graphics/Badges:**
   - Use emojis as placeholders or add SVGs to `/assets/graphics/` and `/assets/badges/`.
4. **No code changes required!** The platform will automatically recognize new quizzes.

---

## User Progress & Badges
- User progress (scores, badges, completed quizzes) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- Badges are awarded for completing quizzes (emoji/SVG shown on the landing page).
- Users can reset their progress from the landing page.

---

## Customization & Extensibility
- **Graphics:** Each quiz can specify a unique graphic (emoji or SVG).
- **Badges:** Each quiz can specify a unique badge (emoji or SVG).
- **Themes:** Each quiz can have its own color theme.
- **Question Banks:** Each quiz loads its own question set from its JSON file.
- **Future:** Easily add authentication, leaderboards, or shareable badges; the codebase is modular for future enhancements.

---

## Development Workflow (Best Practices)
- **Version Control:**
  - Use regular, descriptive git commits (e.g., `git commit -m "Add defense quiz data"`).
  - Branch for features/bugfixes, merge via pull requests.
- **Code Organization:**
  - Keep quiz logic, user logic, and UI logic separated in `/js/`.
  - Use placeholder assets (emojis) for graphics and badges until SVGs are available.
- **Testing:**
  - Test new quizzes and features locally before pushing.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Design for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Static-Only:**
  - All code and assets must be static and client-side (works on GitHub Pages).

---

## Future Enhancements
- SVG/PNG graphics and badges (replace emojis as assets become available)
- User authentication (optional, for cloud sync or leaderboards)
- Leaderboards (local or remote)
- Shareable/downloadable badges
- Dark/light mode theming
- Enhanced accessibility

---

## Placeholders
- Emojis are used as placeholders for graphics and badges.
- Placeholder text or comments are included where future features/assets will be integrated.
