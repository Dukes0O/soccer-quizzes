## Project Overview

This project is a client-side quiz platform for soccer (football) knowledge, designed to run entirely on GitHub Pages. It supports multiple quizzes, custom graphics, badges, and persistent user progress using browser localStorage. The platform is highly modular and easy to extend.

## How to Add a New Quiz

1. **Create Quiz Data:**
   - Add a new JSON file in `/quizzes/` (e.g., `midfield.json`) with at least 15 questions.
   - Use the structure below:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "midfield",
       "title": "Midfield Mastery Quiz",
       "description": "Test your midfield soccer knowledge!",
       "graphic": "üß†",
       "badge": "üéñÔ∏è",
       "animation": "assets/animations/midfield.json",
       "themeColor": "#2563eb",
       "questions": [
         { "question": "Sample?", "options": ["A", "B"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Sample." }
         // ...at least 14 more
       ]
     }
     ```
2. **Update Manifest:**
   - Add an entry for the new quiz in `/quizzes/manifest.json`.
3. **Add Graphics/Badges/Animations:**
   - Use emojis as placeholders or add SVG/JSON assets to `/assets/graphics/`, `/assets/badges/`, and `/assets/animations/`.
4. **No code changes required!** The platform will automatically recognize new quizzes.

---

## Quiz Bank & Randomization
- Each quiz bank contains at least 15 questions.
- When a user starts a quiz, 10 random questions are selected for that session.
- No repeat questions within a single quiz attempt.
- Randomization logic is handled in `quiz.js`.

---

## User Progress & Badges
- User progress (scores, badges, completed quizzes) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- Badges are awarded for completing quizzes (emoji/SVG shown on the landing page).
- Users can reset their progress from the landing page.

---

## Customization & Extensibility
- **Graphics:** Each quiz can specify a unique graphic (emoji or SVG).
- **Badges:** Each quiz can specify a unique badge (emoji or SVG).
- **Animations:** Each quiz can specify a unique animation asset (JSON, Lottie, or placeholder).
- **Themes:** Each quiz can have its own color theme.
- **Question Banks:** Each quiz loads its own question set from its JSON file.
- **Future:** Easily add authentication, leaderboards, or shareable badges; the codebase is modular for future enhancements.

---

## Development Workflow (Best Practices)
- **Version Control:**
  - Use regular, descriptive git commits (e.g., `git commit -m "Add passing & movement quiz bank"`).
  - Branch for features/bugfixes, merge via pull requests.
- **Code Organization:**
  - Keep quiz logic, user logic, and UI logic separated in `/js/`.
  - Use placeholder assets (emojis) for graphics, badges, and animations until SVGs/JSONs are available.
- **Testing:**
  - Test new quizzes and features locally before pushing.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Design for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Static-Only:**
  - All code and assets must be static and client-side (works on GitHub Pages).

---

## Future Enhancements
- SVG/PNG graphics and badges (replace emojis as assets become available)
- User authentication (optional, for cloud sync or leaderboards)
- Leaderboards (local or remote)
- Shareable/downloadable badges
- Dark/light mode theming
- Enhanced accessibility
- More advanced animations (per quiz or per question)

---

## Placeholders
- Emojis are used as placeholders for graphics, badges, and animations.
- Placeholder text or comments are included where future features/assets will be integrated.
