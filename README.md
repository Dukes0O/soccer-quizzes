## Playbook / Graphics Gallery

This project supports a static image gallery for soccer formation diagrams, field graphics, and other reference images, accessible via the main hub page. This is designed for U11 boys to easily browse and learn from visual resources.

### Information Architecture
- `/index.html` is the single top-level entry point, now a hub page with two main sections:
  - **Quizzes** ‚Üí `/quizzes/index.html` (the original landing content, now moved)
  - **Playbook** (Formations & Graphics) ‚Üí `/resources/index.html` (new gallery landing page)
- Navigation between hub, quizzes, and gallery is intuitive for kids.

### Directory Layout
```
soccer-quizzes/
  /resources/              # NEW section
    index.html             # Gallery landing
    formation.html         # (optional) Single formation detail page
    manifest.json          # Metadata for all graphics
  /assets/graphics/        # PNGs or SVGs (e.g., crossing from right.png, field zones thirds.png)
  /js/gallery.js           # Logic to load manifest and render gallery
```

### Gallery Manifest Example
`resources/manifest.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "crossing-from-right",
    "title": "Crossing from Right",
    "description": "Technique for delivering balls from the right flank",
    "image": "assets/graphics/crossing from right.png",
    "themeColor": "#10b981"
  }
]
```

### How the Gallery Works
- `gallery.js` fetches `resources/manifest.json` and renders cards for each formation/graphic.
- Each card: thumbnail, title, description, and a ‚ÄúView Full‚Äù button.
- (Optional) Clicking a card opens `formation.html?id=crossing-from-right` for a full-size image and teaching notes.

### Static Image Handling
- Use **PNG** for complex diagrams/screenshots; use **optimized SVG** for line-art for crisp scaling.
- Place all images in `/assets/graphics/`.
- Add `loading="lazy"` to `<img>` tags for performance.
- Use Tailwind utility `max-w-full h-auto` for responsive images.

### Updating & Extending the Gallery
- To add new graphics:
  1. Place PNG/SVG in `/assets/graphics/`.
  2. Add an entry to `resources/manifest.json` (see example above).
  3. (Optional) Add detail notes as Markdown and link via manifest.
- To add animation: drop Lottie JSON in `/assets/animations/` and reference in the manifest.

### Contribution Workflow
- Add new graphics and manifest entries in a single commit.
- Recommended commit message template:
  ```
  feat(resources): add crossing from right, field zones thirds diagrams + manifest entries
  ```
- PR review/self-review before merging. Confirm GitHub Pages redeploys and share the new URL with the team.

### Future-Proofing
- Track ‚Äúviewed‚Äù formations in `localStorage` (like quiz badges) for unlockable content.
- Support Lottie animations for interactive graphics.
- Extend manifest with Markdown docs for coach/teaching notes.

## Implementation Plan for Gallery Extension

**0. Ground-truth the starting point**
- Clone/pull latest main branch.
- Smoke-test existing quizzes (`index.html ‚Üí quiz cards ‚Üí quizzes/quiz.html`).

**1. Agree on the information architecture**
- Keep `/index.html` as hub; move original landing to `quizzes/index.html`.
- Add hub navigation: ‚ÄúQuizzes‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlaybook‚Äù.
- Add navbar/breadcrumbs for easy navigation.

**2. Create the graphics subsystem**
- Scaffold `/resources/` directory and pages.
- Create `manifest.json` for gallery metadata.
- Use `/assets/graphics/` for images (existing PNGs are already here).
- Implement `/js/gallery.js` to load and display gallery.

**3. Static image handling**
- Use PNG for complex, SVG for line art.
- Lazy-load images and ensure responsive display.

**4. Update shared utilities**
- Optionally generalize `js/renderBadge()` to `renderImage()` for reuse.

**5. Documentation & onboarding**
- Update this README with gallery instructions and workflow.

**6. Implementation sprint (suggested order)**
- Day 1: Move landing, build new hub.
- Day 2: Scaffold gallery MVP.
- Day 3: Add detail page (optional).
- Day 4: Populate content.
- Day 5: Polish and cross-device test.
- Day 6: Merge, release, and share URL.

**7. Future-proofing hooks**
- Unlockable graphics, Lottie support, coach notes via Markdown.

### Windows Directory Creation
If you need to create missing directories, use one command at a time in PowerShell:
```
mkdir resources
mkdir assets\graphics
```
Or, using PowerShell's `New-Item`:
```
New-Item -ItemType Directory resources,assets\graphics
```

## Recent Enhancements

- **Badge Asset Consistency:**
  - All quizzes now use PNG badge assets (`/assets/badges/{quiz}.png`), referenced in both quiz JSON and manifest.
  - Badge display logic updated to render PNGs as images (not text paths or emoji).
  - Quiz cards show large badges; "Your Badges" section shows smaller, downloadable badges.
- **Downloadable Badges:**
  - Users can download earned badges from the "Your Badges" section by clicking on them.
- **Robust Local & GitHub Pages Compatibility:**
  - All fetch paths for quizzes and manifest are relative and robust to both local and GitHub Pages deployments.
  - Enhanced error reporting for missing quizzes or manifest fetch issues.
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Improved badge sizing and layout for clarity and visual appeal.
  - Quiz badge beside each quiz card is larger for prominence, and displays the user's personal best until the badge is earned.
- **Personal Best Tracking:**
  - Each quiz card now displays your highest score achieved ("Personal Best") until you earn the badge (10/10), at which point the badge is shown instead.
- **Cleanup:**
  - Removed obsolete or unused files (e.g., `wordpress-embed.html`).
- **Badge Style Spec:**
  - The badge design system is now documented in `/assets/badge-style.json` for future reference or automated badge generation.

---

## How to Add a New Quiz

1. **Create Quiz Data:**
   - Add a new JSON file in `/quizzes/` (e.g., `midfield.json`) with at least 15 questions.
   - Use the structure below:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "midfield",
       "title": "Midfield Mastery Quiz",
       "description": "Test your midfield soccer knowledge!",
       "graphic": "üß†",
       "badge": "üéñÔ∏è",
       "animation": "assets/animations/midfield.json",
       "themeColor": "#2563eb",
       "questions": [
         { "question": "Sample?", "options": ["A", "B"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Sample." }
         // ...at least 14 more
       ]
     }
     ```
2. **Update Manifest:**
   - Add an entry for the new quiz in `/quizzes/manifest.json`.
3. **Add Graphics/Badges/Animations:**
   - Use emojis as placeholders or add SVG/JSON assets to `/assets/graphics/`, `/assets/badges/`, and `/assets/animations/`.
4. **No code changes required!** The platform will automatically recognize new quizzes.

---

## Quiz Bank & Randomization
- Six quiz banks are provided as examples:
  - **Defense** (updated April 2025)
  - **Passing & Movement** (updated April 2025)
  - **Shooting & Finishing** (updated April 2025)
  - **Soccer Field Awareness**
  - **Attacking with Purpose**
  - **Transitions (Attack ‚Üî Defense)**
- Each quiz bank is a JSON file in `/quizzes/`, containing at least 15 questions. Each quiz attempt randomly selects 10 questions (no repeats per session).

### Example Quiz Bank Structure

```json
{
  "id": "field-awareness",
  "title": "Soccer Field Awareness",
  "description": "Know your field! Boundaries, positions, and smart movement.",
  "graphic": "üó∫Ô∏è",
  "badge": "üìç",
  "animation": "assets/animations/field-awareness.json",
  "themeColor": "#0284c7",
  "questions": [
    { "question": "What‚Äôs the name of the big box in front of your goal?", "options": ["The fun zone", "The 18-yard box (penalty area)", "The midfield", "The restart zone"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The 18-yard box is where the goalie can use hands and where penalties happen." },
    ...
  ]
}
```

---

## Adding New Quizzes

1. Create a new JSON file in `/quizzes/` following the structure above. You can use any of the provided quiz banks as a template.
2. Add the quiz metadata to `quizzes/manifest.json` (id, title, description, graphic, badge, animation, themeColor).
3. Add any new assets (graphics, badges, animations) to the appropriate folders in `/assets/`.
4. No code changes are required‚Äînew quizzes will appear automatically on the landing page!

---

## User Progress & Badges
- User progress (scores, badges, completed quizzes) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- Badges are awarded for completing quizzes (emoji/SVG shown on the landing page).
- Users can reset their progress from the landing page.

---

## Customization & Extensibility
- **Graphics:** Each quiz can specify a unique graphic (emoji or SVG).
- **Badges:** Each quiz can specify a unique badge (emoji or SVG/PNG). Badge graphics have been added to `/assets/badges/`.
- **Animations:** Each quiz can specify a unique animation asset (JSON, Lottie, or placeholder).
- **Themes:** Each quiz can have its own color theme.
- **Question Banks:** Each quiz loads its own question set from its JSON file.
- **Future:** Easily add authentication, or shareable badges; the codebase is modular for future enhancements.

---

## Development Workflow (Best Practices)
- **Version Control:**
  - Use regular, descriptive git commits (e.g., `git commit -m "Add passing & movement quiz bank"`).
  - Branch for features/bugfixes, merge via pull requests.
- **Code Organization:**
  - Keep quiz logic, user logic, and UI logic separated in `/js/`.
  - Use placeholder assets (emojis) for graphics, badges, and animations until SVGs/JSONs are available.
- **Testing:**
  - Test new quizzes and features locally before pushing.
- **Static-Only:**
  - All code and assets must be static and client-side (works on GitHub Pages).

---

## Project Status & Roadmap

### Status Update (April 2025)
- The leaderboard feature with memory persistence is **no longer planned**. Focus is on personal bests and badges for user motivation.
- All legacy files have been removed.
- Badge graphics have been added and are now used for quiz rewards.

### ‚úÖ Accomplished
- Modular quiz platform scaffolded and deployed for GitHub Pages.
- Six quiz banks implemented (see below). Quizzes randomly select 10 out of 15+ questions per attempt.
- **Defense, Passing & Movement, and Shooting & Finishing question banks updated with new content (April 2025).**
- Modern UI/UX: player name entry, radio button answers, "Check Answer" step, animated progress bar, and badge rewards.
- User progress and badges persist across sessions using localStorage.
- Landing page dynamically lists quizzes, badges, and supports modular expansion.
- All code and assets are static and GitHub Pages compatible.

### üöß In Progress / To Do
- **Create and add assets:** SVG/PNG images, icons, and sound effects for quizzes and results.
- **Enhance memory persistence:** Continue testing and improving localStorage so progress, badges, and player names are maintained reliably across sessions and browsers.
- **Quiz unlocking sequence:** Implement logic so quizzes unlock only after a certain date or after completing prerequisite quizzes.

### üí° Future Ideas
- **Advanced Section:** Add a section for advanced quizzes, separate from "Fundamentals" or "Principles".
- **Player Goals:** Allow users to enter and track their personal objectives/goals for the season.
- **Stats Tracking:** Add a (possibly separate) page to track team/player stats for the boys' season (planned for Fall/September).

## Project Status & To Do List

### ‚úÖ Completed (April-May 2025)
- Created a hub landing page (`index.html`) with clear navigation to Quizzes and Playbook (Gallery)
- Moved quiz landing to `/quizzes/index.html` and implemented dynamic quiz card rendering
- Implemented `/resources/index.html` as a gallery landing page that loads from `resources/manifest.json`
- Created `/resources/formation.html` for formation detail, with dynamic rendering based on `?id=...`
- Populated manifests with actual paths for graphics and quizzes
- Used Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and responsive design
- Implemented robust fetch logic for manifests and assets (quizzes, gallery) to work locally and on GitHub Pages
- Added user progress and badge display logic; badges are now PNGs and downloadable
- Improved error handling and debug logging for manifest/asset loading
- Updated README with gallery and quiz extension instructions

### üü° Outstanding / In Progress
- **Cross-Environment Testing:** Finalize and test all fetches and asset loads on both localhost and GitHub Pages (ensure images, manifests, and quizzes load everywhere)
- **Cache Busting:** Add cache-busting query params to JS/CSS includes to prevent browser caching issues after deploys
- **Gallery/Quiz Content Expansion:** Add more graphics and quizzes for broader coverage
- **Future-proofing:** Add support for Lottie/JSON animations in gallery, unlockable content, and Markdown coach notes
- **Documentation:** Expand README for contributors, add troubleshooting for path issues on GitHub Pages

---

**Design Note:**
- No config file is used; all fetch/image paths are simple and relative for easy maintenance.
- Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.) are not included by design for this project/audience.
