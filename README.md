## Project Overview

This project is a client-side quiz platform for soccer (football) knowledge, designed to run entirely on GitHub Pages. It supports multiple quizzes, custom graphics, badges, and persistent user progress using browser localStorage. The platform is highly modular and easy to extend.

## Recent Enhancements

- **Badge Asset Consistency:**
  - All quizzes now use PNG badge assets (`/assets/badges/{quiz}.png`), referenced in both quiz JSON and manifest.
  - Badge display logic updated to render PNGs as images (not text paths or emoji).
  - Quiz cards show large badges; "Your Badges" section shows smaller, downloadable badges.
- **Downloadable Badges:**
  - Users can download earned badges from the "Your Badges" section by clicking on them.
- **Robust Local & GitHub Pages Compatibility:**
  - All fetch paths for quizzes and manifest are relative and robust to both local and GitHub Pages deployments.
  - Enhanced error reporting for missing quizzes or manifest fetch issues.
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - Improved badge sizing and layout for clarity and visual appeal.
  - Quiz badge beside each quiz card is larger for prominence.
- **Cleanup:**
  - Removed obsolete or unused files (e.g., `wordpress-embed.html`).

## How to Add a New Quiz

1. **Create Quiz Data:**
   - Add a new JSON file in `/quizzes/` (e.g., `midfield.json`) with at least 15 questions.
   - Use the structure below:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "midfield",
       "title": "Midfield Mastery Quiz",
       "description": "Test your midfield soccer knowledge!",
       "graphic": "üß†",
       "badge": "üéñÔ∏è",
       "animation": "assets/animations/midfield.json",
       "themeColor": "#2563eb",
       "questions": [
         { "question": "Sample?", "options": ["A", "B"], "correct": 0, "explanation": "Sample." }
         // ...at least 14 more
       ]
     }
     ```
2. **Update Manifest:**
   - Add an entry for the new quiz in `/quizzes/manifest.json`.
3. **Add Graphics/Badges/Animations:**
   - Use emojis as placeholders or add SVG/JSON assets to `/assets/graphics/`, `/assets/badges/`, and `/assets/animations/`.
4. **No code changes required!** The platform will automatically recognize new quizzes.

---

## Quiz Bank & Randomization
- Six quiz banks are provided as examples:
  - **Defense** (updated April 2025)
  - **Passing & Movement** (updated April 2025)
  - **Shooting & Finishing** (updated April 2025)
  - **Soccer Field Awareness**
  - **Attacking with Purpose**
  - **Transitions (Attack ‚Üî Defense)**
- Each quiz bank is a JSON file in `/quizzes/`, containing at least 15 questions. Each quiz attempt randomly selects 10 questions (no repeats per session).

### Example Quiz Bank Structure

```json
{
  "id": "field-awareness",
  "title": "Soccer Field Awareness",
  "description": "Know your field! Boundaries, positions, and smart movement.",
  "graphic": "üó∫Ô∏è",
  "badge": "üìç",
  "animation": "assets/animations/field-awareness.json",
  "themeColor": "#0284c7",
  "questions": [
    { "question": "What‚Äôs the name of the big box in front of your goal?", "options": ["The fun zone", "The 18-yard box (penalty area)", "The midfield", "The restart zone"], "correct": 1, "explanation": "The 18-yard box is where the goalie can use hands and where penalties happen." },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Adding New Quizzes

1. Create a new JSON file in `/quizzes/` following the structure above. You can use any of the provided quiz banks as a template.
2. Add the quiz metadata to `quizzes/manifest.json` (id, title, description, graphic, badge, animation, themeColor).
3. Add any new assets (graphics, badges, animations) to the appropriate folders in `/assets/`.
4. No code changes are required‚Äînew quizzes will appear automatically on the landing page!

---

## User Progress & Badges
- User progress (scores, badges, completed quizzes) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- Badges are awarded for completing quizzes (emoji/SVG shown on the landing page).
- Users can reset their progress from the landing page.

---

## Customization & Extensibility
- **Graphics:** Each quiz can specify a unique graphic (emoji or SVG).
- **Badges:** Each quiz can specify a unique badge (emoji or SVG).
- **Animations:** Each quiz can specify a unique animation asset (JSON, Lottie, or placeholder).
- **Themes:** Each quiz can have its own color theme.
- **Question Banks:** Each quiz loads its own question set from its JSON file.
- **Future:** Easily add authentication, leaderboards, or shareable badges; the codebase is modular for future enhancements.

---

## Development Workflow (Best Practices)
- **Version Control:**
  - Use regular, descriptive git commits (e.g., `git commit -m "Add passing & movement quiz bank"`).
  - Branch for features/bugfixes, merge via pull requests.
- **Code Organization:**
  - Keep quiz logic, user logic, and UI logic separated in `/js/`.
  - Use placeholder assets (emojis) for graphics, badges, and animations until SVGs/JSONs are available.
- **Testing:**
  - Test new quizzes and features locally before pushing.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Design for keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **Static-Only:**
  - All code and assets must be static and client-side (works on GitHub Pages).

## Project Status & Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Accomplished
- Modular quiz platform scaffolded and deployed for GitHub Pages.
- Six quiz banks implemented (see below). Quizzes randomly select 10 out of 15+ questions per attempt.
- **Defense, Passing & Movement, and Shooting & Finishing question banks updated with new content (April 2025).**
- Modern UI/UX: player name entry, radio button answers, "Check Answer" step, animated progress bar, and badge rewards.
- User progress and badges persist across sessions using localStorage.
- Landing page dynamically lists quizzes, badges, and supports modular expansion.
- All code and assets are static and GitHub Pages compatible.

### üöß In Progress / To Do
- **Create and add assets:** SVG/PNG images, icons, badge graphics, animations, and sound effects for quizzes and results.
- **Enhance memory persistence:** Continue testing and improving localStorage so progress, badges, and player names are maintained reliably across sessions and browsers.
- **Remove legacy files:** Delete `wordpress-embed.html` and any other unused or legacy files.
- **Quiz unlocking sequence:** Implement logic so quizzes unlock only after a certain date or after completing prerequisite quizzes.

### üí° Future Ideas
- **Advanced Section:** Add a section for advanced quizzes, separate from "Fundamentals" or "Principles".
- **Player Goals:** Allow users to enter and track their personal objectives/goals for the season.
- **Stats Tracking:** Add a (possibly separate) page to track team/player stats for the boys' season (planned for Fall/September).

---

## Future Enhancements
- SVG/PNG graphics and badges (replace emojis as assets become available)
- User authentication (optional, for cloud sync or leaderboards)
- Leaderboards (local or remote)
- Shareable/downloadable badges
- Dark/light mode theming
- Enhanced accessibility
- More advanced animations (per quiz or per question)

---

## Placeholders
- Emojis are used as placeholders for graphics, badges, and animations.
- Placeholder text or comments are included where future features/assets will be integrated.
